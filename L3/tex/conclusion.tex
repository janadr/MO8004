\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The discrepancies in Figure \ref{fig:velocities} noted in Section \ref{sec:results} are most likely due to the estimation method failing in edge cases. I.e., in the case of the group velocity, the method may choose the wrong second maximum as multiple are present in the same time frame, and so the direction and speed is wrong. As for the phase velocity, the situation is more ambiguous, and requires a deeper analysis.
