Rossby waves are essential in large-scale atmosphere-ocean dynamics as information transmitters and for distributing vorticity. In general, Rossby waves are generated from the planetary vorticity gradient, but they may also be generated from topography. Exploring these two types of Rossby waves mainly for the ocean, we will also consider the effect of a mean flow, as present in the atmosphere.
