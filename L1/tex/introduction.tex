\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Geostrophic adjustment is the process where an unbalanced pressure perturbation adjusts to achieve geostrophic balance. A central concept of the large-scale general circulation, we will explore geostrophic adjustment by numerically solving the shallow water equations (SWEs). In particular, we will look at the flow characteristics and energetics under a set of scenarios.

In Section \ref{sec:theory} we present the SWEs and central analytical results, while the numerical method is described in Section \ref{sec:method}. A few central results are shown in Section \ref{sec:results} and briefly discussed in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}, wrapping up the report.
